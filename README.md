# A Vue.js template for Vite

This is a school projec that we had about one week to complete.
Requirements for this project was to use a API (with at least ten values), text interpolation, attribute interpolation, conditional rendering, list rendering, events, v-model, router-link and routerview, at least one none Vue-Router component, prop and some style with Sass.
